Subject: Urgent: Outstanding Concerns with BDO Application Development for Meritos

Dear [Development Team],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to address the concerns I recently raised regarding the development of the BDO (Business Development Operations) application for our client, Meritos Pharmaceuticals. Unfortunately, the issues I highlighted have not been adequately addressed in the prototype that was delivered.

I want to emphasize the urgency of this matter as we are nearing a crucial milestone in the project timeline. It is essential that the identified concerns are resolved promptly to ensure a successful implementation of the BDO application for Meritos Pharmaceuticals.

Here is a list of additional comments and issues that need to be addressed:

1. Incomplete Dashboard: The dashboard lacks important metrics and visualizations that were agreed upon during the requirements gathering phase. We need to ensure that all the relevant data is displayed clearly and intuitively.

2. Functionality Errors: I have come across several functional errors while navigating through the application. For example, the search feature is not returning accurate results, and the data filtering options are not functioning as expected.

3. Performance Issues: The application is experiencing significant performance issues, such as slow loading times and lag during data entry. These issues need to be addressed to ensure a smooth user experience.

4. Mobile Responsiveness: The application does not adapt well to mobile devices, making it challenging to use on smartphones or tablets. It is crucial that the BDO application is mobile-responsive to accommodate users who require access on the go.

Given the severity of these concerns, I kindly request your immediate attention to resolve these issues. It is essential that the revised version of the BDO application addresses all the mentioned comments and is delivered within the next two days.

Furthermore, I would appreciate if you could provide me with a detailed action plan outlining the steps that will be taken to rectify these issues and the estimated timeline for each fix. This will allow me to keep our client, Meritos Pharmaceuticals, informed about the progress and expected resolution timeframe.

I understand the challenges involved in software development, but I trust in your expertise to overcome these obstacles swiftly and deliver a high-quality BDO application that meets the expectations of our client.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a successful resolution of these concerns.

Best regards,

George
